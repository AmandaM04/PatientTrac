# PatientTrac

PatientTrac allows doctors to search for patients inside the database and view any or all medications the patient is currently taking. Doctor can choose Patient tab inside Navbar to
display a list of their current patients. Doctors can add medications that aren't currently in the database from the Medications Tab in the navbar. If a patient is no longer seeing the
doctor, they can be deleted by the doctor from their current patient list. The patients can not be deleted from the database. Medications assigned to a patient can not deleted from the
patients profile. STOP DOCTOR SHOPPING!
